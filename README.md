# 🚀 ProductSplashPage

## 🎯 Project Objective
This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in **high-performance frontend layouts**. The focus was on creating a conversion-optimized splash page that balances visual aesthetics with technical performance, specifically focusing on typography, layout hierarchy, and responsive scaling.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Semantic HTML5:** Used a strict semantic structure (header, section, main, footer) to ensure the page is readable by screen readers and search engines.
* **CSS Flexbox & Grid:** Implemented a hybrid layout system to handle complex hero sections and feature grids without using a CSS framework.
* **Asset Optimization:** Focused on using modern image formats and lazy loading to ensure the "Splash" experience is near-instant.
* **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** Utilized custom media queries to ensure the Call-to-Action (CTA) elements remain prominent on mobile devices.

## 🔍 Key Challenges Solved
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Ensuring the most important product information is visible "above the fold" across different screen heights (laptops vs. tablets).
* **CTA Placement:** Optimizing the button and form layouts for thumb-reachability on mobile devices.
* **Consistency:** Maintaining exact padding and margin ratios to create a "premium" feel across the entire page.

## 🚧 Project Limitations
* **Static Frontend:** This is a UI/UX demonstration. The newsletter signup forms and buttons are visual placeholders and are not currently connected to a backend.
* **Vanilla Build:** I avoided Tailwind/Bootstrap to prove mastery of core CSS positioning and architecture.
